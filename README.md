# FiveM-Utils
These two python files can significantly speed up the process of building a FiveM Server.<br />
ensure.py lists everything that needs to be started into output.txt ith just the input of the resources directory.<br />
getVehicles.py creates a list of all installed vehicles with just the input of the resources directory and stores them in vehicles.text. This can be useful for the vMenu spawnlist etc..

## Usage
1. Start the file you want to use with Python (I recommend to do this in vscode)
2. enter the whole path to the resources folder (e.g. D:\Games\GtaRP\Fivem_server\FiveM\resources)
3. press enter and open either output.txt or vehicles.txt to find your results.

## Known Bugs
- ensure.py lists directorys with brackets [] around them
- ensure.py lists pre installed librarys by the FiveM server
